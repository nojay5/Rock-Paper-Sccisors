# Rock-Paper-Sccisors
In this project, I investigated how different strategies affect outcomes in rock-paper-scissors, focusing on situations where players have an "edge." For example, I simulated a match-up where Player 1 throws rock half the time, while Player 2 throws scissors two-thirds of the time. This gives Player 1 a theoretical 9% advantage.

Through simulations, I found that despite this edge, Player 1 can still perform worse than the optimal random strategy about 5% of the time, simply due to chance. In rare cases, Player 1, despite the advantage, lost up to 17 times in a row. By experimenting with simulation sizes, I created empirical distributions that closely match the expected theoretical outcomes, revealing just how much randomness can impact results, even when an advantage exists.
